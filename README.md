Download torrents using Colab

If you've come here then you're already aware of Google Colab. It is a tool for Machine Learning researchers to share their work. They provide a remote Jupyter notebook that runs on a linux environment with 12Gigs of RAM and ~300 Gigs of disk space. 

My college LAN has blacklisted downloads from torrents. So modern problems require modern solutions. Here's how to download torrents and transfer it to your google drive.


NOTE: This is for educational purposes only. There is no intention to eploit free resources provided by COLAB.
